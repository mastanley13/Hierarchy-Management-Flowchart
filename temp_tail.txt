if none → flag uplineNotFound
if both upEq and upQu present and upEq != upQu → flag uplineConflict
```

### Testing Scenarios (Added)
- Only `Upline Code Equita` set → resolves correctly.
- Only `Upline Code Quility` set → resolves correctly.
- Both set and equal → resolves; no conflict.
- Both set and different → flags `uplineConflict`; honors precedence.
- Upline code set but no contact has matching `NPN` → `uplineNotFound`.

### Open Questions (Updated)
- Do `Upline Code Equita`/`Quility` always contain NPNs, or can they contain non-NPN vendor codes? If vendor codes are possible, do we have direct contact fields for each agent’s own `Equita Code` / `Quility Code` to support mapping?
- Which source should win if both upline fields are populated with different values? Is Equita-first acceptable, or should this be location-configurable?
